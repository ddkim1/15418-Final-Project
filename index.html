                            <p>
                                Minesweeper is a popular logic puzzle computer video game in which the playerâ€™s objective is to clear the grid while not clicking on any of the hidden mines. To determine the location of the mines, players will be given clues in the form of numbers on spaces, where the number indicates the number of adjacent squares that contain a mine. Despite its simple nature, it has been proved as a co-NP complete problem. [1] As a result, efficient sequential implementations currently do not exist, and performance gains will be found through parallelization. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this project, our goal will be to first implement a sequential program that is able to solve a board by clearing the board while not exposing any mines. Afterwards, we aim to build upon our work by parallelizing this program using several different parallel frameworks. The general approach towards solving a board is that we will look at every possible square, and denote the probability for each square that it contains a mine. From there, the program will mark off any squares that for sure have mines, and then click on squares with the lowest probability of containing a mine. This process continues until the board is cleared. However, especially for large grids, this becomes a very slow process to perform sequentially, as at each step, the program would have to analyze every square at each step to determine which square to click next, especially if there are numerous squares that are guaranteed to contain mines. Instead, if we were to parallelize the program by, for instance, dividing the squares of the grid across different parallel workers, it could lead to substantial speedup.

                            <p>
                                The workload is difficult to perfectly balance largely due to there being less mines or potential squares to click in certain areas of the board. Ideally, if we were to perfectly divide the workload across the parallel workers, then each worker would have an equal number of mines in their assigned squares; however, that is not necessarily the case, as Minesweeper often has large areas of squares with no mines nearby. Attempting to find a good workload split that balances the workload across the workers will be challenging as a result.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                In addition, communication also makes workload balance quite difficult. If a worker manages to mark a square as a mine, or if a worker manages to clear a square as not a mine, then it needs to communicate this information to other workers that may use this information to be able to clear their squares. This then becomes a challenge of determining which workers we need to communicate with whenever we clear a square. Designing such algorithms to divide the workload as evenly as possible might need us to research existing literature to delve into heuristics or stochastic nature of the bomb nature. 
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                Another challenge originates from the nature of the game. Sometimes, minesweeper requires the user to guess on which step to proceed. In this case, it favors the recursive parallelization methods like OpenMP. However, we want to still achieve good results using data parallelism tools like OpenMPI or CUDA. In addition, given that we have a powerful GPU or a powerful CPU with many cores, we would also like to try to parallelize our solver to perform multiple guesses at once. All of these thoughts are interesting and also challenging to implement.

                                Our end goal is to achieve speedup relative to the sequential version of the solver. 
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Deliverables are summarized in the following list (1-3 are what we plan to achieve, while 4 is what we hope to achieve): 
                                1). We will develop an efficient working version of the sequential solver of the game, which is capable of running on both CPU and GPU platforms. 
                                2). After that, we would build upon the sequential version and finish our initial effort of parallelization using OpenMP and CUDA.
                                3). For each parallel implementation, after we successfully finish our programs we will attempt to determine better workload distributions in hopes of improving speedup.
                                4). We hope to build a visualization tool to showcase the speed of our parallelized solver and also implement a parallel solver using MPI if time permits.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                In summary, we plan to achieve a working sequential, CUDA, and OpenMP implementation, in addition to a script that will check for both correctness of our implementation as well as the speedup we achieve in comparison to a sequential implementation. We also hope to achieve an implementation using MPI, and in addition to the speedup graphs for the parallel implementations, we also hope to have a form of live demonstration of the parallel solvers at the poster session. Through the graphs and the live demonstrations, we hope to showcase the speedup we obtained from parallelizing our program, in addition to which parallel framework we found to work the best for this particular problem.
                            </p> 
                            <p> 
                                Through our analysis, we are hoping to learn how fast a minesweeper solver can be made through parallelization, and we are also hoping to learn the applicability of parallelization in improving the performance of algorithms for NP-complete problems such as minesweeper. <strong>For more details about the platforms and resources we plan, please checkout the project proposal linked before. </strong>
